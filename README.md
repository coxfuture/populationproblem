# populationproblem
A python program that "flips coins" to determine how many people cross a border, a wildly overdone solution to a problem given in MAP2302 (Differential Equations) at Saint Petersburg College. 

The most recent file is immmigration_fittesting.py as of writing this, although it should be more or less identical to immigration.py in terms of results.
The fittesting file uses a different method for the curve fitting step.
